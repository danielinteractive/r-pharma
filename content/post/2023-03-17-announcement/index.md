There is much excitement for R/Pharma 2023! Please find below the plan for the gathering!

Based on the 2022 conference feedback, it is clear people are keen to get back together in person, as we did at Harvard in 2018 and 2019. Moreover, people very much like our virtual gathering and the accessibility for all people across the world.  

Our 2023 plan is to have in-person and virtual components, as detailed below!

## In-Person

R/Pharma is partnering with Posit to host our in-person portion at posit::conf(2023) in Chicago. posit::conf(2023) runs Sunday, September 17 - Wednesday, September 20, 2023.

Attendees at posit::conf(2023) will find three ways to interact with R in Pharma content!

Register for two days of workshops and choose one or both of the R/Pharma offerings:

-  Sunday, Sept 17 - Pharma-focused workshop
-  Monday, Sept 18 - R/Pharma Roundtable Summit

You can additionally register for the Conference and attend many talks relevant to pharma:

-  Tuesday, Sept 19 - Wednesday, Sept 18 - Conference Talks

Our featured in-person event will be the *R/Pharma Roundtable Summit* on Sept 18th. Over the last five years, we’ve seen explosive growth in the use of R and other open-source technologies across drug development, with an increasing focus on open-source projects and pan-company collaboration. 

In this one-day series of roundtables, we aim to provide an open, collaborative, and inclusive environment to share learnings, understand common themes across our industry, and establish collaboration opportunities. The focus of the R/Pharma Roundtable Summit is to foster in-person discussions and conversations about key items (reproducibility, submissions, etc.), as we did at Harvard. You can find a sample agenda for the R/Pharma Roundtable Summit here: https://rinpharma.github.io/positconf-roundtables-2023/

The Pharma-focused workshop, as well as the R/Pharma Roundtable Summit, are part of the posit::conf workshop offerings taking place on days 1 and 2 (September 17 - 18). You can purchase the workshop pass on its own or in addition to the conference pass, which allows you to attend days 3 and 4.

If you would like to submit a Pharma talk for the posit::conf(2023), please find the information on the [Posit blog](https://posit.co/blog/posit-conf-2023-registration-open/#contribute-to-conf). To submit a talk, you’ll need to create a 60-second video that introduces you and your proposed topic. In the video, you should tell us who you are, why your topic is important, and what the attendees will take away from it. Submission closes at midnight on March 28 anywhere on Earth, and Posit will communicate decisions by April 24.

## Virtual

Our Free virtual gathering will be on October 24 and 25. The first day will be *R/Pharma*, and the 2nd day will be *Open Source in Pharma*, featuring talks about Python, Julia, Stan, Javascript, and other open-source languages.

The workshops will run the week before, October 16 - 20. The style and format will be very similar to 2020-2022 etc. We plan to offer free Digital Credentials for people that attend and complete the workshops.
