### Calling all opensource developers! Come Show off your packages and shiny apps!

Do you have an R package or shiny app that you want to showcase at R/Pharma?  
We are excited to announce that R/Pharma 2021 will feature a virtual exposition hall which will give you the opportunity to showcase an R package or shiny app in a virtual booth.  The expo will be open throughout the entire three day event.

- You can run a video or slideshow for attendees to see when they click on your booth
  - Suggestion - a video of your app in use
- If you are present in your booth you can video chat with visitors or show a live demo
- Each booth has its own dedicated chat window
- You can schedule a demo and invite other attendees (simply announce that you'll be demoing at a particular time on the conference chat).
- **We'll do all the virtual booth set-up work for you**
