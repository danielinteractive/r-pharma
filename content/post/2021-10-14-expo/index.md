### Calling all opensource developers! Come Show off your packages and shiny apps!

Do you have an R package or shiny app that you want to showcase at R/Pharma?  
We are excited to announce that R/Pharma 2022 will feature a virtual exposition hall which will give you the opportunity to showcase an R package or shiny app in a virtual booth.  The expo will be open throughout the entire three day conference event.
The R/Pharma expo was a highlight of the virtual conference in 2020 and 2021 and we are aiming to continue that in 2022.

- You can run a video or slideshow for attendees to see when they click on your booth
  - Suggestion - a video of your app in use or some screen captures
- If you are present in your booth you can video chat with visitors or show a live demo
- Each booth has its own dedicated chat window
- You can schedule a demo and invite other attendees (simply announce that you'll be demoing at a particular time on the conference chat).
  - We won't be including specific times in the schedule for people to come to the Expo
- **We'll do all the virtual booth set-up work for you**

More details on the booths and how to register one will be coming soon.

*Please note - No vendor or commercial products.  R/Pharma is committed to opensource*
