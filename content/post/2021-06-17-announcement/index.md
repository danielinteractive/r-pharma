We are pleased to announce R/Pharma 2021 !!

R/Pharma 2021 will be held as a free virtual conference from November 2-4, 2021 with workshops running the week before.

More details on keynote speakers and call-4-papers will follow shortly.

R/Pharma 2020 was a huge success as a virtual event with over 1000 registrations.  We decided to keep the 2021 conference virtual in order to include as many participants as possible.  For 2022 we are aiming to hold a hybrid event.
