At R/Pharma we know it's important to take regular breaks during a virtual event.  We try to make these breaks fun and are excited to introduce you to three friends of R/Pharma who will be providing some entertainment this year.

He is also interested in the computational implementation of statistical models, especially in R. He has recently founded the Theoretical and Statistical Ecology Group (https://tsecolgroup.wordpress.com) and since 2020 has been producing musical parodies to teach Statistics (http://tinyurl.com/rafamoral). In his spare time he enjoys playing guitar and writing music, as well as performing magic tricks. Last, but not least, he loves German Shepherd dogs!

## Mike Smith

Mike K. Smith is the lead of the R Centre of Excellence at Pfizer. He trained as a statistician, and after a period working in the Pharmacometrics modelling and simulation group he returned back to the Statistics organisation. He describes himself as a professional geek at work, and this label works equally well for his musical output. Mike likes to use randomness and probability in making music, which can be labelled as generative ambient music. You can think of it as soundtracks and textures for films and pictures that don’t exist. He makes music as MikeKSmith and his released music can be found on Bandcamp at https://mikeksmith.bandcamp.com/ with “work in progress” on SoundCloud at https://soundcloud.com/mikeksmith.
