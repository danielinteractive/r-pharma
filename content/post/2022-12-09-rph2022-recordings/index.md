That's not all ... Like in previous years, the R/Pharma Conference offered a terrific lineup of workshops covering many innovative approaches to using R and other open source software in analysis pipelines and application development. You can view the workshop recordings on the [R/Pharma 2022 Workshop Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMtxz1fUYA5AWYQHB5mZAs-yamNJ5Tm_8). Be sure to view the description of the workshop video for resources shared during the workshops.

R/Pharma would not be possible without the talented members of our organizing and program committees, workshop instructors, presenters, and the life-sciences community. We hope you enjoy the recordings and look forward to our events in 2023!
