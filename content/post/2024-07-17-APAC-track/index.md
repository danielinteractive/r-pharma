We are super excited to announce the new APAC Track for the R/Pharma 2024 conference!

## Context
R/Pharma 2024, the conference on all things [Open Source in Pharma](http://opensourceinpharma.com/), will take place October 29th-31st 2024, preceded by Training Days the week prior. The conference will be fully virtual. For all details including topics see the [call for talks](https://rinpharma.com/post/2024-06-08-call4talks/).


## News
This year, we embrace the global nature of the R/Pharma community, by opening for the first time ever an Asia-Pacific (APAC) Track of the conference. This will run during APAC daytime hours - a few days might be APAC mornings, a few APAC evenings, but we will avoid the APAC nighttime. We will be hosting presentations, workshops and panel discussions, as well as streamings of keynote recordings from the global track.


## Call to Action: What does this mean for you?
First, definitely mark your calendars for October 29th-31st 2024 and the week before for the workshops, whether you are in APAC or elsewhere in the world.  
Second, think which topic you have been working on would be cool to share with the R/Pharma community via a short talk. And donâ€™t be afraid - we will offer coaching, also in the APAC time zones to help you develop your talk! Please submit your talk via https://sessionize.com/rpharma/ until July 31st - just complete the form introducing yourself and your proposed topic, and please note the checkbox related to presenting in the relevant time zone.  
Third, if you have any questions, please use the form on our [contact page](https://rinpharma.com/contact/) to have your question routed to the organizing committee Slack channel or email the APAC committee directly via daniel@rconis.com.

Thanks a lot in advance for your engagement!
