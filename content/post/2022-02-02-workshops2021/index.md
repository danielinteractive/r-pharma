## R/Pharma Workshops

During R/Pharma 2021 we were excited to host 14 free workshops along with the conference.  Workshops ran for 2-4 hours and were hosted by members of the community.  The workshops are one of the highlights of R/Pharma and we are indebted to the hosts who prepare and host them, highlighting the community effort the R/Pharma fosters.  Over 1000 people attended an R/Pharma workshop in 2021.
